## 1. INTRO SECTION ON MAIN PAGE (right on the top)

**Replace current intro text with:**

I am Valentine, a French singer, guitarist, and classically trained violinist, passionate about Celtic music and currently residing in Oxfordshire, England.

My musical journey began in Le Havre, France, where a love for traditional song blossomed into a professional path. This passion led me to five years of classical violin studies at the Conservatoire de musique de Nîmes, where I earned my Grade 8 ABRSM diploma. Now based in the UK, I share my love for music by teaching violin, performing my solo Celtic repertoire at various events, and continuing my classical violin studies.

## 4. NEW PAGE - ABOUT PAGE

**Create new about.html page with the following content:**

My musical journey began in Le Havre, France, in a family steeped in music. My earliest memories are of singing French songs with my father before bed, a tradition that sparked a lifelong passion. When I was thirteen, my father gave me my first guitar, which opened up a new world of expression for me.

From a very young age, I had fallen in love with the rich, soulful melodies of Celtic music. By the age of fourteen, I had built a repertoire of traditional Celtic ballads with voice and guitar and was performing at weddings, concerts, and festivals like the 'Normandie Celtic Festival' and 'Automne Musical en Vallespir'. Eager to learn a new instrument, I took up the violin at fifteen and, a year later, was accepted into the Conservatoire de musique de Nîmes.

For five years, I immersed myself in classical music studies, earning my Grade 8 ABRSM diploma with distinction. My musical world expanded as I performed with orchestras in different countries, including the Penang Symphony Orchestra in Malaysia. I also had the opportunity to join the traditional Irish folk group JigFiz's, with which I performed at various Celtic Bals and Saint Patrick's Day events.

In 2024, I began a new chapter when I moved to Oxford with my Welsh husband, Adam. Today, I am continuing my classical violin studies while teaching violin to students across Oxfordshire and online. I also regularly perform my solo Celtic repertoire in churches and at events, and I am dedicated to my ongoing development as both a musician and music teacher.
