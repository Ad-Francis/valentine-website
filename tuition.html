                    <h3>Building Strong Foundations</h3>
                    <p>I believe that every great violinist starts with solid fundamentals. My face-to-face teaching allows me to closely observe and correct posture, bow technique, and intonation in real-time. Being physically present means I can make immediate adjustments and provide hands-on guidance that makes all the difference.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Making Music Enjoyable</h3>
                    <p>Learning violin should be a joyful experience! In the comfort of your own home, I create a relaxed atmosphere where you can focus on making music. I incorporate pieces you love alongside classical studies, ensuring that every lesson is engaging and motivating. From Celtic folk tunes to movie soundtracks, we'll explore music that inspires you.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Comfortable Learning Environment</h3>
                    <p>There's something special about learning in your own space. Students often feel more relaxed and confident at home, leading to faster progress and greater enjoyment. Plus, family members can observe and support your musical journey, creating a wonderful shared experience.</p>

The attention to detail to what specific parts I struggle with she is able to pick up on and explain in detail."</blockquote>
